    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
      The client was the DriverPass company, they wanted us to design a system that would help new drivers by scheduling classes and providing study resources.
    What did you do particularly well?
      I believe that I did particularly well at planning the system in accordance with the customer's requirements. While it was a bit challenging at first, I felt like I got the hang of it after a few reiterations.
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
      I could revise a part of my documents, I would fix the part where I describe how each component interacts with each other. After re-reading it, I believe that I could have better explained certain parts.
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
      I implemented the user's needs into my system design by first trying to understand what they wanted to achieve - to be more precise, why did they request the things that they did? I then looked at the different ways that these use cases could be met. It's important to consider the user's needs because without them, you're designing a system for nobody.
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
      I approach designing software as a continuous process. As roadblocks come up or requirements change, it's important to be able to efficiently revise your design without compromising your design timeline. In the future, I would plan to ask more questions to get a better idea of what the customer wants.
